Kachai vocalic developments


Vowels by offset

i1 = i that can feed palatalization and then become ɐ (in that order)
i2 = i that does not feed i1 > ɐ stuff but is early enough to triggre palatalization. Later merges into i3. 
i3 = i after loss of i1 and too late to feed palatalization

e2 = secondary e after coda stuff happened to it. 


ɐ2 = secondary ɐ that is too late to be affected by the shifts that happen to ɐ itself, e.g. becoming u word finally, and perhaps going to o before n, i or a before t. Unclear before velars as ɐ can retian its quality before those. But passage from i to this is before palatalizatoin thus bleeding it. 
ɐ3 = too late for the above and also late enough that passage if to ɐ is after palatalizatoin 

a1 = merge into a early enough to be affected by the earliest vowel mutations that happen to a, such as coda > u2
	(aŋ > a2 not a1, ŋ must drop after a1 effects resovle)
a2 = too late for coda a position effects, 

u2 = u2 after non-post-labial > ɐ at coda, but before h > f before round vowels
u3 = u2 after u-distortions and also after h > f

o1 = merged in and sharing o's developments
o2 = o after o's own effects and before ŋ > ∅
o3 = merged after o > ɐ and after ŋ > ∅

aj1 = sharing aj's development

  $ PKU *ow -- all to e. After things happen to original e 
  $ PKU *oj -- all to i. After things happen to original i. $Thus merge with most ɨ. Does happen after labials too (pi, mi).
