$Ukhrul CFR built ex nihilo using Diasim for diagnostics. Did not consult the proposed cascades in the Slack chat - -will run them later if requested. (@author Clayton Marr, @date 1/27~28/2024)

$ This first part covers shared Kachai-Ukhrul developments. 

$hr , hl > r l . Moved up as it is shared with Kachai. 
h > ∅ / __ [+cor,+son]

$h epenthesized before onset a-. Shared with Kachai. 
∅ > h / # __ a

$pʷ merged into w, bʷ to v for now. Chronology of pʷ/bʷ/w mergers (and then secondary split with v) revised in consideration of Kachai. 
pʷ > w
bʷ > v

$elimination of the remaining voiced consonants through various means here. Already lacking g, sound change conspiracy ensues that removes the rest.
$1. d not in clusters passes to r (one exception of tuŋ has apparent homophone split. Maybe this was actually dlung?) 
$ based on evidence from Kachai, it is likely this was actually originally d > ð (as still extant in Kachai) before ð merged with r (in Ukhrul). Changed to reflect this. 
d > ð / __ [+syl]

$2. remaining d (i.e. in dl-) and b are devoiced.
[-cont] > [-voi]

$remaining Cr- & Cl- and remaining Cw- lose their sonorant element -- or that was how I originally formulated this (revised under influence of Kachai CFR, see below). Explains all 11 cases except rwok > ok, but that word alone is too little to go on. Under consideration of Kachai, it seems that the Cr & Cl outcomes are shared, but not the remaining Cw- outcomes, so this is reflected here, wiht +cor added as a restriction on the output. 
[+son,+cor,-syl] > ∅ / [-syl] __

$aa and uu become long vowels.
{a a;u u} > {aː;uː}

$w lost in C __ V, shared with Kachai, except before high vowels. In Ukhrul this remains h but in Kachai the majority of these cases -- which happen to be #hw- because that is the majority of remaining Cw- clusters, end up as f. However there is a secondary explanation in this being caused by vowels that had been rounded by a later point of Kachai for this. The idiosyncracy of being blocked before high vowels nevertheless points to common development for this one. 
w > ∅ / [-syl] __ [-hi,+syl]

=Proto-Kachai-Ukhrul
$end of shared Ukhrul-Kachai developments. 

$ð merged into r
ð > r

$coda l > w after round vowels, else to -j. 
l > w / [+round] __ 
l > j / [+syl] __

$w (<pʷ and w merge with v (<bʷ) prevocalically. 
[+round,-syl] > v / __ [+syl]

$[uw] and [ij] sequences, both conspicuously absent from the input, are leveled. In theory dealing with toher h
{u w;uː w;w u;i j} > uː;uː;uː;uː;iː}

$a > ɐ before stops (1 exceptionː pʷak > vak; but 8 other cases for -ak; 4 for -ap, 7 for -at) and nasals (1 exception ciaŋ > caŋ; otherwise 9 cases for -aŋ, 3 cases for -an, 7 for -am), and before -r (6 cases). Does not effect long aː though. Both exceptions are after possible glides but n=2 is not enough to posit htat as causative fimrly. 
a > ɐ / __ [+cons,-lat]

$loss of length. Must be after a > ɐ phenomena, which it counterfeeds. 
[+syl] > [-long]

$ ɨ merges to u
ɨ > u

$ w > j after o, dissimilation
w > j / o __

$ o raises to u before j 
o > u / __ j


$... but then v, of any source, goes back to w before o. 
v > w / __ o 


$Secondary ɐ-loweringː both etymological ɐ and ɐ < a are lowered in two environments.
$	[+hi,-cont] __ [+nas] 	(kʰam, kan, kaŋ, caŋ) 
$	[+strid] __ [-cont] 	(ʃat, ʃat, ʃap, tsat, tsat, sak, vak, vat)
		$ (this one is fed by w> v and both fed & bled by ts > c)  
ɐ > a / [+hi,-cont] __ [+nas]
ɐ > a / [+strid] __ [-cont]
