$Kachai CFR built ex nihilo using Diasim for diagnostics. Did not consult the proposed cascades -- can run them if requested. (@author Clayton Marr, @date 1/27~28/2024)

$hr , hl > r l . Placed early as it is shared with Kachai. 
h > ∅ / __ [+cor,+son]

$h epenthesized before onset a-. Shared with Kachai. 
∅ > h / # __ a

$pʷ merged into w, bʷ to v for now. 
pʷ > w
bʷ > v


$prevocalic d passes to ð, before the loss of l in dl and the devoicing of those secondary d- onsets ot t-. 
d > ð / __ [+syl]


$remaining d (i.e. in dl-) and b are devoiced.
[-cont] > [-voi]

$remaining Cr- & Cl- lose their sonorant element. Shared with Ukhrul. 
[+son,+cor,-syl] > ∅ / [-syl] __

$aa and uu become long vowels.
{a a;u u} > {aː;uː}

$hw > h before a and o. One would be exception is before ɨ (lateɾ > i) , so non-high vowels is a good guess. Upon later consideration it appears that hte best way to handle this is just w effacement in these places, rather than the previous theory of a Proto-Ukhrul-Kachai *ɸ. In Ukhrul this remains h but in Kachai the majority of these cases -- which happen to be #hw- because that is the majority of remaining Cw- clusters, end up as f. However there is a secondary explanation in this being caused by vowels that had been rounded by a later point of Kachai for this. The idiosyncracy of being blocked before high vowels nevertheless points to common development for this one. The two cases of pu > fu do still tease a *ɸ, but a whole sound change can't be proposed based off two homophones.  
w > ∅ / [-syl] __ [-hi,+syl]

=Proto-Kachai-Ukhrul
$ End of shared developments with Ukhrul

$PKU *e becomes *i word-initially and before coronals. Before *n and *t and thw word bound, this is early enough to feed i's own development into ɐ there (although to o in po), before r it is early enough to trigger palatalization. Word finally however it is after the i > ɐ phenomena (and no evidence that it triggered palatalization. Dealing with pre-coronal phenomena here, therefore.
e > i / __ [+cor]

$ɐ temporarily rises to ə, distinct from ɨ still, but not low so as to not trigger loss of final ŋ

=Proto-Kachai I
$after first wave of vowel mutations, with palatalization and labialization of consonants triggered by i and u as the boundary. 

$ ts appears to pass to ð except when before an i that is NOT before another consonant. Separately, t-, dl- (> tl- > t) and c- onsets appear to become ts- precisely in this context (i, without a following consonant). This all is clearly BEFORE Proto-Ukhrul-Kachai ɨ moves to i. Ciang is the only ci- word (nad htere are no ce- words before the passage of aj- and ow- to e.), and it goes to t͡s, so c might be a good thing to blame, given its place of articulation. Furthermore, there is the case of tser > cir (but tsej > ði).  This all has to happen before i > ɐ.
$1. coronal non-continuants go to c before i unless it is closed by a consonant. 
[+cor,-cont] > c / __ i {#;[-cons]}

$2. remaining ts passes to ð
