$Kachai CFR built ex nihilo using Diasim for diagnostics. Did not consult the proposed cascades -- can run them if requested. (@author Clayton Marr, @date 1/27~28/2024)

$hr , hl > r l . Placed early as it is shared with Kachai. 
h > ∅ / __ [+cor,+son]

$h epenthesized before onset a-. Shared with Kachai. 
∅ > h / # __ a

$pʷ merged into w, bʷ to v for now. 
pʷ > w
bʷ > v


$prevocalic d passes to ð, before the loss of l in dl and the devoicing of those secondary d- onsets ot t-. 
d > ð / __ [+syl]


$remaining d (i.e. in dl-) and b are devoiced.
[-cont] > [-voi]

$remaining Cr- & Cl- and remaining Cw- lose their sonorant element. Shared with Ukhrul. 
[+son,-syl] > ∅ / [-syl] __

$ End of shared developments with Ukhrul.

$hw > f before a and o. One would be exception is before ɨ (lateɾ > i) , so non-high vowels is a good guess. 
h w > f / __ [-hi,+syl]

$ ts appears to pass to ð except when before an i that is NOT before another consonant. Separately, t-, dl- (> tl- > t) and c- onsets appear to become ts- precisely in this context (i, without a following consonant). This all is clearly BEFORE Proto-Ukhrul-Kachai ɨ moves to i. Ciang is the only ci- word (nad htere are no ce- words before the passage of aj- and ow- to e.), and it goes to t͡s, so c might be a good thing to blame, given its place of articulation. This all has to happen before i > ɐ.
$1. coronal non-continuants go to c before i unless it is closed by a consonant. 
[+cor,-cont] > c / __ i {#;[-cons]}

$2. remaining ts passes to ð
t͡s > ð 

$3. ci- (and ce-?) to ts(i,e). Gesture reassignment? 
c > t͡s / __ [+front,-lo] 

$ Proto-Kachai-Ukhrul *ɨ > i, but too late to feed i > ɐ
