$Ukhrul CFR built ex nihilo using Diasim for diagnostics. Did not consult the proposed cascades in the Slack chat - -will run them later. (1/27~28/2024)

$h epenthesized before onset a- 
∅ > h / # __ a

$coda l > w after round vowels, else to -j. 
l > w / [+round] __ 
l > j / [+syl] __

$[uw] and [ij] sequences, both conspicuously absent from the input, are leveled. 
$ this can be roped in with the replacement of the (orthographic) aa ii uu wiht a i u, whether this represents the loss of length of the loss of a hiatus vowel. 
$This must resolve AFTER the raising of short a, because it counterfeeds that. 
$I'll consider this as first the emergence of long segments, then their shortening. Current alpha bug prevents using htis, but this is really what's happening:  [-cons,ɑlo,βround,ɣfront,ðhi,ɛtense,ɸback] [-cons,ɑlo,βround,ɣfront,ðhi,ɛtense,ɸback] > [+long] ∅
{a a;u u;u w;i j} > {aː;uː;uː;iː}

$a > ɐ before stops (1 exceptionː pʷak > vak; but 8 other cases for -ak; 4 for -ap, 7 for -at) and nasals (1 exception ciaŋ > caŋ; otherwise 9 cases for -aŋ, 3 cases for -an, 7 for -am), and before -r (6 cases). Does not effect long aː though. Both exceptions are after possible glides but n=2 is not enough to posit htat as causative fimrly. 
a > ɐ / __ [+cons,-lat]

$loss of length
[+syl] > [-long]

$ w > j after o, dissimilation
w > j / o __

$ o raises to u before j 
o > u / __ j
