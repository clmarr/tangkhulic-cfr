$Ukhrul CFR built using Diasim for diagnostics. Did not consult the proposed cascades in the Slack chat - -will run them later. (1/27~28/2024)

$h epenthesized before onset a- 
∅ > h / # __ a

$elimination of the remaining voiced consonants through various means here. Already lacking g, sound change conspiracy ensues that removes the rest.
$1. d not in clusters passes to r (one exception of tuŋ has apparent homophone split. Maybe this was actually dlung?) 
d > r / __ [+syl]

$2. remaining d (i.e. in dl-), bʷ and b are devoiced.
[-cont] > [-voi]

$coda l > w after round vowels, else to -j. 
l > w / [+round] __ 
l > j / [+syl] __

$hr , hl > r l 
h > ∅ / __ [+cor,+son]

$remaining Cr- & Cl- and remaining Cw- lose their sonorant element. Explains all 11 cases except rwok > ok, but that word alone is too little to go on.
[+son,-syl] > ∅ / [-syl] __


$pʷ (< pʷ or bʷ) and w become v prevocalically. 
[+round,-syl] > v / __ [+syl]


$[u(ː)w] and [ij] sequences, both conspicuously absent from the input, are leveled. 
$ may have involved lengthening but no specific evidence of that at this time. 
$ In theory, should be the following but there may be alpha errors : [+hi,-cons,-syl,βround] > ∅ / [+syl,+hi,βround] __
{u w;uː w;i j} > {u;uː;i}

$a > ɐ before stops (1 exceptionː pʷak > vak; but 8 other cases for -ak; 4 for -ap, 7 for -at) and nasals (1 exception ciaŋ > caŋ; otherwise 9 cases for -aŋ, 3 cases for -an, 7 for -am), and before -r (6 cases). Does not effect long aː though. Both exceptions are after possible glides but n=2 is not enough to posit that as causative fimrly. 
a > ɐ / __ [+cons,-lat]

$loss of length
[+syl] > [-long]

$ ɨ merges to u
ɨ > u

$ w > j after o, dissimilation
w > j / o __

$ o raises to u before j 
o > u / __ j


$... but then v, of any source, goes back to w before o. 
v > w / __ o 


$Secondary ɐ-loweringː both etymological ɐ and ɐ < a are lowered in two environments.
$	[+hi,-cont] __ [+nas] 	(kʰam, kan, kaŋ, caŋ) 
$	[+strid] __ [-cont] 	(ʃat, ʃat, ʃap, tsat, tsat, sak, vak, vat)
		$ (this one is fed by w> v and both fed & bled by ts > c)  
ɐ > a / [+hi,-cont] __ [+nas]
ɐ > a / [+strid] __ [-cont]
