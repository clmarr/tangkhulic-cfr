$Rebecca's rules for Huishu

c > t͡s 
$ ^ 8 etyma curr effected. Sept 26 removed redundant #. 

$vowels go to e before t, which Rebecca seems to note feeds j epenthesis for ʃut, tʰat, hrit, ʃat, thus coming before it. Affects 9 etyma: 2 for u > e, 3 for ɐ > e, 3 for a > e, 1 for i > e. 
{u;a;i;ɐ} > {e;e;e;e} / __ t

$vowel changes before p: 
$[+syl,-round,-lo] > e / __ p 
	$  ɐ, i  > e / __ p
	$ there don't seem to be any examples of etymological ɨp# so this can be roped in. ap# cannot though. ip# has only one example. 
	$ Just one word effected : jip > jep. 
	$ Nov 2024 -- removed. /ɐ/ is low ironically anyways, but this is entirely spurious. There is, separately, hri > ... > re and mi > .... > me (but ri >... > re) so there may be something separate going on with i > e here. 

[+syl,+round,+back] > ɐ / __ p
	$ u, o > ɐ / __ p
	$ just 2 words affected as Feb 16, one each for u and o: kup, khop > kɐp, khɐp.


$ɨ to u, before u-conditioned final k-insertion. 5 etyma affected. 
ɨ > u

$the following before a > e / __ j, before j-deletion and before j-epenthesis (hrit > rejʔ): e, o > u / __ j. 
	$ Many etyma affected
[+syl,-hi,-lo] > u / __ j

$j-epenthesis, before final t-glottalization (ʃɐt > tsejʔ).
	$Many etyma affected. Sept 26 redundant # removed. 
∅ > j / e __ t 


$ vowel changes before k, which must happen before final k-insertion. Does not impact long /aː/. 4+ etyma affected for each. 
{o;i;a} > {u;o;o} / __ k

$ final stop glottalization. Rebecca notes it comes before i > o (apparentlly conditioned on this) and before a secondary word final k-insertion after u (e.g. bʷu > vuk). Since these are the only final stops, can just formulate the target as [-cont]. 
$ as of Feb 8, this only happens to p after a though, which is correct except that it seems to also happen after /aː/. 
$ simpler form from before then: [-cont] > ʔ / __ #
[-cont,-lab] > ʔ / __ # 
p > ʔ / [+lo,+tense] __
	$ currently, using corrected version where it affects long /a:/ too is above. To be faithful to hte current version, can use this rule instead of the above: p > ʔ / a __ # . Sept 26: redundant # rmeoved. 

$ tense nonhigh (e, a) vowels to o before w. There are many examples for /a/ but only one for /e/. Apparently does not effect long /aː/. 
[+tense,-hi,-long] > o / __ w

$ final k insertion after u and i. Must come before o and ɐ secondarily become u in final positions. After a > i but before i > e. Many etyma affected, four apparent exceptions. The exceptions all after [+son] [+front,+syl,-lo] (li,me,hri > re,ri) but there are counterexceptions to thiese (ri > lik, 3 cases of ni > nik).
∅ > k / [+hi,+syl] __ #

$ uj to u, after e > u / __ j and after final k insertion.
$ many affected items, looks good.  
$ Sept 26: redundant # removed. 
j > ∅ / u __

$vowel changes before r, generally involving backing and rounding. Must happen before final r effacement. Distinguishes short and long a.
	 $ 3 cases for /ar/, 3 for /or/, 1 each  for /ir/ /ɐr/ /er/. Current writeup has this excluded for a after another /a/ but there don't seem to be any instances of this. The cases of waːr and saːr are rightfully excluded though. 
{o;i;a;ɐ;e} > {u;u;o;o;ɐ} / __ r

$ engma deletion after o . Per Hannah Feb 21. Redundant # removed Sept 26. 
ŋ > ∅ / o __

$ rule I (Clayton) inserted on Feb 19 -- instead of becoming /e/ like it does elsewhere at the coda, /a/ becomes /aː/ in N __ #, which will soon become /i/.
a > [+long] / [+nas] __ #

$word-final vowel changes. After final j deletion, after pre-rhotic vowel changes, now before final engma deletion.
	$ solid for o# 
	$ e# has only one case: hwe > hwi. 
	$ ɐ# also has only one case: mɐ > mu 
	$ a# has many cases that go to e#, but also many go further to i. DiaSim's context autopsy gets a phi score of 0.56 for +nas as a prior feature and it seems that there's 6 cases there and on exceptions. So I am implementing that as a rule below. 
{o;a;e;ɐ} > {u;e;i;u} / __ #

$vowel changes before engma. Distinguishes long and short a; must be before final engma deletion
$ Earlier version : {o;a;i} > {u;o;ɐ} / __ ŋ 
$ in mid early Feb (8-11) 2024, this is modified so that o is excluded and a dis not affected in aa sequences (which evidently are still around at this time.). Since /a/ otherwise ,and /i/ always, comes after a consonant in the relevant words, this is expressed as a prior context requisite of [+cons].
{a;i} > {o;ɐ} / [+cons] __ ŋ

$engma deletion after a:, o, u, e. Of course short a has just become o in this position. So this can be formulated in terms of context as [-hi,+tense,+syl]. Comes before e and o get raised before coda. Described as before V V > V but this seems unnecessary since it would have been before a if all aŋ sequences were disturbed by the previous rule. Many examples, one exception ʃoŋ > ... > sɐŋ.
$ correct by rebecca to exclude u, rightly, in mid early feb. 
$ Sept 26: redundant # removed. 
ŋ > ∅ / [+tense,+syl,-hi] __

$ A rule I (Clayton) inserted here -- comment  out to be faithful to the original: aa and aː, including aː from /a/ in N __ #, become /i/ when final. a: (one exceptionː caːŋ > tsa. Can be handled by making /aː/ only do so after   continuants but based on a single exception this seems unwarranted.) 
a a > aː
aː > i / __ #

$word-final r effacement. Sole exception is t͡ser > t͡sɐr. 
r > ∅ / __ #

$Clayton-inserted rule: rw > jw. Suppress if need to be faithful to current version. Two examples. 
r > j / __ w

$Clayton-inserted rule: Cw > C before u. Five examples. Fed by rw > jw. 
w > ∅ / [-syl] __ u

$cluster simplification rules.
$ w effacement -- but this is before h-effacement 
$ Currently suppressed in favor of rule above. Desuppress if need to be faithful to current version. 
$w > ∅ / [-syl] __

$ d effacement. Before l-deletion. 3 examples, all check out. 
d > ∅ / __ [-syl] 

$ h effacement. Before r-effacement. 
$ faithful versoin: h > ∅ / __ [-syl]
$ Clayton correction: does not occur if the following vowel is high. 
h > ∅ / __ [-syl] [-hi]

$ l effacement and r effacement. 
[+son,+cons,+cor] > ∅ / [-syl] __ 

$ d-rhotation, prevocalic. 7 examples. Sept 26: redundant # removed. 
d > r / __ [+syl] 
 
$ ʃ-fronting initially. There are 4 cases where you instead get t͡s, with mysterious conditioning. Sept 26: redundant # removed. 
ʃ > s 

$ Rebecca has a rule "VOWEL VOWEL > VOWEL" here. I'll interpret this as a modified a-hiatus-deletion rule, given the changes I made to the handling of /aa/ sequences above. Original rule would be : a a > a. Institute that if need to be faithful. The relevant cases are two: thaow > tow and thuu > thu. 
[+syl] > ∅ / __ [+syl]

$ pre-n vowel changes. Before n iotation and n > ŋ . Well instantiated - -single exception of ŋun looks nonprobative. 
$ pre 2/19 version: {ɐ;a;i;u;o} > {e;e;ɐ;ɐ;ɐ} / __ n
$ CM-fix @ 2/19-- aː shares afate of /a/ here if not elsewhere -- so basically [+lo]  > e.
$ CM-fix: the fate of vowels is the same before /n/ and /l/ so they are both handled in tandem 
{ɐ;a;aː;i;u;o} > {e;e;e;ɐ;ɐ;ɐ} / __ [+cor,+son]

$ n-iotation. Must be after prenasal vowel changes. 3 examples. 
n > j / e __ #

$ pre-j vowel changes. 
$ now just of a > e; e > u now much earlier. Before j-deletion, before n > j, after j-insertion. Well instantiated, one odd case : khaj > khu. 
a > e / __ j

$ CM-inserted rule: final ej > e after non-nasal coronals. # not redundant here, many are followed by glottal stop. 
j > ∅ / [+cor,-nas] e __ #

$ pre-m vowel changes. 10 cases. The one exception is otherwise unexpected in its coda too: sum > suŋ
{i;u} > {ɐ;ɐ} / __ m

$  l and n > ŋ ŋ. Distinct treatment of long and short vowels maintains. 
$ CM-FIX SUPPRESSED: just merge this with the pre-N phenomena.
$ {u;o;i} > {ɐ;ɐ;ɐ} / __ l

$ l and n become engma after ɐ. After u and o become ɐ, and ɐ > e phenomena. Sept 26: redundant # removed. 
{l;n} > {ŋ;ŋ} / ɐ __ 

$ b bʰ bʷ become v. Later, remaining rounded consonants pass to w. 7 cases. Sept 26: redundant # removed. 
[-cont,+voi,+lab] > v 

$remaining rounded consonants pass to w. Sept 26: redundant # removed, and [-syl] made more specific to [+cons] 
[+cons,+lab,+round] > w

$initial t- to k-. Sept 26: redundant # removed. 
t > k

$ inserted.
$ loss of any vowel length
[+syl] > [-long]
